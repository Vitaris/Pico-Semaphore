# Pico-Semaphore

Pico-Semaphore is an open-source project designed to introduce students to the world of programming, electronics, and 3D printing. The project is built around the Raspberry Pico RP2040 microcontroller and utilizes MicroPython for easy programming.

## Features
* LED Matrices: The traffic signal is implemented using 8x8 WS2812B LED matrices, with three matrices connected in series for a visually engaging display.
* 3D Printable Parts: All plastic components required for the semaphore can be easily 3D printed, allowing users to customize and manufacture their own parts.
* PIO-Driven LEDs: The LED matrices are efficiently controlled using the Programmable I/O (PIO) interface of the Raspberry Pico RP2040. This ensures precise and synchronized control over the LEDs, enhancing the educational experience by delving into hardware-level programming concepts.
* Simplicity: The project is designed with simplicity in mind, making it accessible for schools to replicate. The goal is to provide an educational tool that is easy to build and understand.
* Configurable Traffic Loop: The semaphore's traffic light sequence can be configured using a JSON file, allowing for flexibility in educational scenarios.
